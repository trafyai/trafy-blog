By strategically arranging elements based on their importance, designers can direct users focus and facilitate seamless interaction. Visual hierarchy is established through factors such as size, color, contrast, and placement.",
          "Key components, such as calls-to-action and important information, should be prominently displayed to draw users attention effectively. Conversely, less critical elements should be visually subdued to prevent distraction. By understanding the principles of visual hierarchy, designers can create interfaces that are visually engaging and easy to navigate."
